/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for VoicePlan application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for private data under `/users/{userId}`.
 * Public read access is granted to the `shared_plans` and `shared_itineraries` collections,
 * but only authorized users can create and modify documents within those collections.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored in `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Plans, Tasks, Reminders, People, Organizations, and Locations are nested under `/users/{userId}/plans/{planId}...`.
 * - Shared plans are stored in `/shared_plans/{planId}` and `/shared_itineraries/{itineraryId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly private and only accessible by the owning user.
 * - Listing of users is disallowed.
 * - Shared plans are publicly readable but require validation on creation to ensure correct ownership.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Plan` document contains the `userId` to avoid needing to query the `/users/{userId}` document for authorization.
 * - Task, Reminder, Person, Organization, and Location documents contain the `planId` for similar authorization independence.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private plans and tasks are stored under the user's path (`/users/{userId}/plans/{planId}`).
 * - Publicly shared plans are stored in a separate top-level collection (`/shared_plans/{planId}`).
