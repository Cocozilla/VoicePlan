/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for VoicePlan application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data stored
 * within Firestore. Each user has exclusive access to their own data tree,
 * preventing unauthorized access and modification.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore data is organized hierarchically, with user data nested under
 * the `/users/{userId}` path. Plans, tasks, and reminders are further nested
 * under their respective parent documents, maintaining a clear ownership
 * structure.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data.
 * - Listing other users is disallowed.
 * - The shared_plans collection is publicly readable to resolve the reported error, but this may be undesirable from a privacy perspective.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  The ruleset leverages path-based ownership for authorization.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  Private user data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` collection,
 * ensuring that it is not mixed with public data.
